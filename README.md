# Data warehouse design for the airline case study.
In this repository I have uploaded the files I made to build a data warehouse with multidimensional structure. I understand as "build a data warehouse" the process of design, implementation and ETL load process. The work sequence was:
1. designing the data warehouse (dimension hierarchy and fact table) that suits both requirements and data source (read "1. Data warehouse_design.pdf")
2. coding a script in SQL language to implement the complete data warehouse on Oracle SQL Developer and generating star schema on Oracle Data Modeler (read "2. Data warehouse_implementation.pdf")
3. loading the input data (from CSV files) into the database by applying ETL transformations on the intermediate main stream of data (read "3. Data warehouse_etl.pdf")
